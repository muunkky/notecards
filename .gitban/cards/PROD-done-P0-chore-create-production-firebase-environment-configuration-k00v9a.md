## Notes
All Firebase configuration is Infrastructure as Code:
- No manual Firebase Console configuration needed
- All settings version-controlled
- Repeatable and auditable
- Automatic deployment on push to main

**The "single configuration file" you asked for is the combination of:**
1. `firebase.json` (infrastructure)
2. `.github/workflows/prod-deploy.yml` (deployment process)
3. `package.json` (build scripts)

Push to main → Everything deploys automatically.
