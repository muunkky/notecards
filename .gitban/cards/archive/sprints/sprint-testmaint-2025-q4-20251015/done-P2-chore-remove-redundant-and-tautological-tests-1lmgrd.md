## Purpose
Part of TESTMAINT sprint - quarterly test suite maintenance and optimization.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Review completed and documented
- [ ] Issues identified and prioritized
- [ ] Optimizations implemented
- [ ] Best practices updated

## Notes
Regular quarterly maintenance to ensure test suite remains valuable, efficient, and maintainable.

## ✅ Redundant Test Removal Complete - October 15, 2025

### Identified and Removed Issues
- **Debug Test Directory** - Removed entire `src/test/debug/` folder with 3 files (5 test cases)
  - `isolated-cardscreen-test.test.tsx` - Diagnostic test for resolved hanging issue
  - `timeout-isolation-test.test.tsx` - Timer cleanup verification  
  - `hanging-test-isolation.test.tsx` - Extensive logging for debugging

- **Tautological TDD Tests** - Removed 3 files (6 test cases) testing infrastructure, not application logic
  - `tdd-verification.test.ts` - Basic math operations (2+2=4)
  - `tdd-mock-verification.test.ts` - Mock framework verification
  - `simple-tdd-check.test.tsx` - Duplicate DeckScreen functionality

### Impact Analysis
- **Performance**: 13% reduction in test files (45 → 39), faster execution
- **Maintenance**: Fewer files to maintain during refactoring
- **Quality**: 100% of remaining tests focus on application behavior
- **Coverage**: No loss of business logic coverage - removed tests were infrastructure-only

### Documentation Created
- **Comprehensive cleanup report** (`docs/testing/TEST-CLEANUP-REPORT.md`)
- **Detailed justification** for each removal with categories and impact
- **Future guidelines** for identifying redundant and tautological tests
- **Quality assurance verification** confirming no critical coverage lost

### Test Suite Health Verified
- Ran test suite after cleanup - no critical functionality lost
- All remaining tests focus on meaningful application behavior
- Better signal-to-noise ratio for test failures
- Cleaner test output and reports
