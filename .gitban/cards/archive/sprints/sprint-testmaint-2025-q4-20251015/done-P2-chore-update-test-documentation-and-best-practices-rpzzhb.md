## âœ… Progress Update - October 15, 2025

### Completed Actions
- **Created comprehensive testing best practices document** (`docs/testing/TESTING-BEST-PRACTICES.md`)
- **Analyzed current test infrastructure** - Vitest 3.2.4, React Testing Library, Puppeteer E2E
- **Documented test architecture** - Clear categorization and organization structure
- **Established performance standards** - Unit (10ms), Integration (100ms), E2E (30s), Full suite (2min)
- **Defined coverage guidelines** - 80% minimum, 95% for critical paths
- **Identified anti-patterns** - Redundant, tautological, flaky, and brittle tests

### Key Documentation Sections Added
1. **Test Structure & Organization** - Clear directory layout and naming conventions
2. **Best Practices** - Writing quality tests with proper isolation and async handling
3. **Anti-Patterns** - Common mistakes to avoid with examples
4. **Maintenance Procedures** - Quarterly health review checklist
5. **Debugging Guidelines** - Local and CI/CD debugging procedures
6. **Security Testing** - Authentication and data protection test strategies

### Current Test Suite Status
- **Running efficiently** - Tests complete quickly without hanging issues
- **Comprehensive coverage** - Unit, integration, E2E, regression, and performance tests
- **Well-organized** - Clear directory structure with feature-specific organization
- **Properly configured** - Enhanced setup.ts with aggressive cleanup

### Next Steps
- Analyze test coverage metrics from vitest coverage run
- Review for redundant and tautological tests
- Implement quarterly health review procedures
