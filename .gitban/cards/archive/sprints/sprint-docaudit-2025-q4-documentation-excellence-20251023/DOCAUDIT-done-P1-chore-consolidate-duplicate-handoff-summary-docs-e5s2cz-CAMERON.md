# Consolidate Duplicate Handoff Summary Docs

**Type:** Chore
**Priority:** P1
**Status:** in_progress
**Owner:** CAMERON

## Description
Remove duplicate handoff documentation files that exist in both root and docs/communications/.

## Analysis
Root files (outdated):
- FINAL-HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md (174 lines) - Missing git workflow section
- FINAL-MONTH-HANDOFF-AUGUST-2025.md (268 lines)
- HANDOFF-README.md

Docs versions (current):
- docs/communications/FINAL-HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md (197 lines) - Has git workflow, marked as archived
- docs/communications/FINAL-MONTH-HANDOFF-AUGUST-2025.md (267 lines) - Current version

## Tasks
- [x] Compared root vs docs/communications versions
- [x] Confirmed docs/communications versions are more current
- [x] Removed FINAL-HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md from root (outdated)
- [x] Removed FINAL-MONTH-HANDOFF-AUGUST-2025.md from root (outdated)
- [x] Removed HANDOFF-README.md from root (redundant)
- [x] Verified docs/communications/ has canonical versions

## Decision
✅ Keep: docs/communications/* versions (current, properly organized)
❌ Remove: Root versions (outdated, redundant)

## Result
✅ Single source of truth in docs/communications/
✅ Root directory cleaned of 3 duplicate handoff files
✅ All handoff documentation properly organized
