# Consolidate Duplicate Browser Service Architecture Docs

**Type:** Chore
**Priority:** P1
**Status:** in_progress
**Owner:** CAMERON

## Description
Remove duplicate Browser Service Architecture documentation - two files exist with different content.

## Analysis
- **Root file:** BROWSER-SERVICE-ARCHITECTURE.md (45 lines, 2.9K)
  - Shorter, focused on service account auth
  - Recent updates about authentication flows
- **Docs file:** docs/Browser-Service-Architecture.md (218 lines, 6.5K)
  - Comprehensive reference documentation
  - Full API documentation with code examples
  - Better organized with sections

## Tasks
- [x] Compared both files for content differences
- [x] Determined docs version is more comprehensive and complete
- [x] Deleted redundant root file (BROWSER-SERVICE-ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [x] Verified docs/Browser-Service-Architecture.md remains as canonical source

## Decision
✅ Keep: docs/Browser-Service-Architecture.md (comprehensive, 218 lines)
❌ Remove: BROWSER-SERVICE-ARCHITECTURE.md (redundant, 45 lines)

## Result
✅ Single source of truth for Browser Service documentation
✅ Root directory cleaned of duplicate file
