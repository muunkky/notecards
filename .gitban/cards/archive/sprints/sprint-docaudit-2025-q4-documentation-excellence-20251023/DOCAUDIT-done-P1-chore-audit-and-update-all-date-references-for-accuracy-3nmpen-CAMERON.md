# Audit And Update All Date References For Accuracy

**Type:** Chore
**Priority:** P1
**Status:** backlog
**Created:** Generated via MCP

## Description
Audit and update all date references for accuracy

## Tasks

### Date Audit Conducted
- [x] Searched all markdown files for date references (Last Updated, completion dates, etc.)
- [x] Verified current date context: October 23, 2025
- [x] Identified and categorized all date occurrences across 51 documentation files

### Date Errors Found and Fixed
- [x] Fixed DESIGNSYS-SPRINT-COMPLETION.md delivery date: "December 20, 2024" → "October 17, 2025"
- [x] Fixed DESIGNSYS-SPRINT-COMPLETION.md sprint duration description to match actual 2-week timeline
- [x] Fixed DESIGNSYS-SPRINT-COMPLETION.md cards completed count (3/6 → 12/28)
- [x] Fixed DESIGNSYS-FINAL-SUMMARY.md sprint name: "2024-Q4" → "2025-Q4"
- [x] Fixed DESIGNSYS-FINAL-SUMMARY.md archive location reference to use correct year

### Date Accuracy Verified
- [x] docs/README.md - "October 23, 2025" ✓ (created today)
- [x] docs/HISTORY.md - "2025-09-01" ✓ (accurate last content update)
- [x] docs/sharing/* - September 2025 dates ✓ (accurate, no content changes since)
- [x] docs/communications/* - August/September 2025 dates ✓ (archived documents)
- [x] docs/testing/* - October 2025 dates ✓ (current)
- [x] CHANGELOG.md - "2025-10-17" for v0.0.2 ✓ (matches release)

### Issues Identified (Beyond Scope)
- [x] Documented gitban archive folder naming inconsistency (some use "2024-q4" for 2025 sprints)
- Note: Actual folder names in .gitban/cards/archive/sprints/ have mixed 2024/2025-Q4 naming
- This is a filesystem/gitban issue requiring folder renames, beyond documentation audit scope

## Implementation Details

Conducted comprehensive date audit across entire documentation tree. Fixed 5 date errors in sprint summaries where December 2024 was incorrectly listed for October 2025 completion.

All "Last Updated" dates in active documentation verified as accurate - September dates reflect actual last content updates (file renames don't constitute content changes worthy of date updates).

Archive folder naming inconsistency noted but not fixed (requires gitban archive folder renames).

Result: All documentation dates accurate and consistent with actual project timeline.
