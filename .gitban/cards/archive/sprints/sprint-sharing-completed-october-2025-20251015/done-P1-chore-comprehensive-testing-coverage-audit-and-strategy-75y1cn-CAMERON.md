## Objective
Conduct a comprehensive audit of testing coverage across the entire codebase and establish a world-class testing strategy that matches the standards of elite engineering teams (Google, Meta, Netflix-level quality).

## Context
- Current testing infrastructure includes unit tests (294 tests), E2E tests, functions tests, and rules tests
- Need to identify gaps, establish coverage baselines, and create a roadmap to achieve exceptional testing quality
- Goal: Make testing so comprehensive that production bugs are virtually impossible

## Desired End State - World-Class Testing Standards

### Coverage Metrics (Google-Level Standards):
- **Line Coverage**: ≥ 90% across all production code
- **Branch Coverage**: ≥ 85% for all conditional logic
- **Function Coverage**: 95%+ for all public APIs
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% for authentication, data persistence, sharing, payments (if applicable)
- **Mutation Testing Score**: ≥ 80% (tests catch intentional bugs)

### Test Distribution (Industry Best Practices):
- **70% Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated, granular component testing
- **20% Integration Tests**: Service interactions, API contracts, database operations
- **10% E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys, acceptance criteria validation

### Test Quality Standards:
- **Test Reliability**: < 0.1% flaky test rate (tests must be deterministic)
- **Test Speed**: Unit test suite completes in < 2 minutes
- **Test Independence**: Zero interdependencies between tests (can run in any order)
- **Test Clarity**: Every test has clear Given/When/Then structure or equivalent
- **Test Maintenance**: < 5% of development time spent fixing tests (low maintenance burden)

### Documentation & Infrastructure:
- **Coverage Reports**: Automated generation with trends over time
- **Coverage Gates**: CI/CD fails if coverage drops below thresholds
- **Missing Coverage Report**: Clear identification of untested code paths
- **Test Strategy Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for all test types
- **Test Utilities**: Shared fixtures, factories, mocks properly organized

## Non-Objectives
- Not aiming for 100% coverage (diminishing returns after 90%)
- Not testing external library internals (only our usage of them)
- Not replacing manual QA entirely (some exploratory testing still valuable)
- Not creating tests that duplicate functionality (avoid test redundancy)

## Detailed Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Standards:

**What to Test:**
- All pure functions with edge cases
- React component rendering (all prop combinations)
- State management logic (reducers, actions, selectors)
- Utility functions and helpers
- Data transformations and formatting
- Business logic and calculations

**How to Test:**
- Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- One assertion per test (logical assertion, not literal)
- Test file co-located with source (e.g., `Button.test.tsx` next to `Button.tsx`)
- Use descriptive test names: `it('should disable submit when form is invalid')`
- Mock external dependencies (Firebase, APIs, browser APIs)

**Coverage Targets:**
- Critical business logic: 100%
- UI components: 85%
- Utilities/helpers: 95%
- Configuration: 70%

### Integration Testing Standards:

**What to Test:**
- Firebase auth + Firestore interaction
- Service layer orchestration
- Browser service + authentication flow
- Data synchronization between components
- Real-time listeners and subscriptions

**How to Test:**
- Use Firebase emulators for real service simulation
- Test actual network calls (not mocked)
- Verify data persistence and retrieval
- Test error handling and retry logic
- Validate transaction boundaries

**Coverage Targets:**
- All external service integrations: 90%
- Critical data flows: 100%

### E2E Testing Standards:

**What to Test:**
- Complete user journeys (signup → create deck → add cards → study)
- Critical workflows (sharing, collaboration)
- Error recovery scenarios (network failures, auth errors)
- Cross-browser compatibility (if needed)
- Mobile responsive behavior (if needed)

**How to Test:**
- Use real browser + real Firebase (or emulators)
- Test from user perspective (no implementation details)
- Focus on critical happy paths
- Test one user journey per test
- Keep E2E suite small and focused (< 30 minutes runtime)

**Coverage Targets:**
- Top 10 user journeys: 100%
- Error recovery paths: 80%

### Test Organization Best Practices:

```
src/
  components/
    Button/
      Button.tsx
      Button.test.tsx          # Unit tests
      Button.integration.test.tsx  # Integration tests (if needed)
  services/
    firebase/
      auth.ts
      auth.test.ts            # Unit tests
      auth.integration.test.ts # Integration with Firebase
  test/
    e2e/                      # E2E tests
    fixtures/                 # Test data factories
    helpers/                  # Test utilities
    setup/                    # Global test setup
```

### Test Data Strategy:

- **Factories**: Use factory functions for test data generation
- **Fixtures**: Store reusable test data as JSON/modules
- **Realistic Data**: Use production-like data (anonymized)
- **Randomization**: Use seeds for reproducible random data
- **Cleanup**: Always clean up test data (teardown hooks)

### Flaky Test Prevention:

- **No arbitrary waits**: Use `waitFor` with conditions
- **Proper async handling**: Always await promises
- **Deterministic data**: Use fixed timestamps, IDs
- **Isolated state**: No shared state between tests
- **Retry logic**: Only for E2E tests, never for unit tests

## Progress Update - October 4, 2025

### Session 1: Test Infrastructure Audit & Baseline

#### Accomplishments:
1. **Fixed Test Runner Coverage Support** ✅
   - Fixed `scripts/run-tests-log.mjs` to properly handle `--coverage` flag
   - Issue: npm's `--` separator was being passed as filter, causing "No run files found"
   - Solution: Filter out standalone `--` and properly pass coverage config to startVitest
   - Commits: `24bedca6`, `348bec19`

2. **Established Testing Baseline** ✅
   - **38 test files** currently in the project
   - **~282 unit tests** (close to the 294 mentioned in original card)
   - All tests passing (some skipped for missing credentials)
   - Test execution time: ~15-20 seconds for full suite

3. **Test Categories Identified**:
   - Unit tests: Components, hooks, utilities, Firebase integration
   - E2E tests: Real browser UI, service account integration
   - Rules tests: Firestore security rules validation
   - Functions tests: Cloud functions (in functions/ directory)

#### Issues Discovered:
1. **Coverage Collection Hangs** ⚠️
   - Tests start running with coverage enabled
   - E2E tests complete quickly (3 checkmarks visible)
   - Unit tests never finish - hangs for 40+ minutes
   - Coverage tmp files created but never finalized to HTML report
   - Multiple node worker processes spawn but don't complete
   - Needs investigation: possible timeout issue, memory problem, or infinite loop in coverage collection

#### Technical Details:
- Vitest v3.2.4 with @vitest/coverage-v8
- Coverage reporter configured for: text, json, html
- Test pattern: `src/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,mjs,cjs,ts,mts,cts,jsx,tsx}`
- Excludes: node_modules, dist, src/test/, config files

#### Next Steps:
1. Investigate coverage hang - try running subset of tests with coverage
2. Check if specific test files cause hang
3. Consider alternative: run vitest directly with --coverage flag
4. Once coverage works, analyze gaps and create improvement roadmap

#### Files Modified:
- `scripts/run-tests-log.mjs` - Fixed coverage flag handling
- `.kanban/cards/` - Archived E2E testing sprint, started coverage audit


## Coverage Investigation Results



**Root Cause Identified**: Coverage collection with full test suite hangs indefinitely

#### Test Results:
- ✅ **Single file coverage**: Works perfectly (5s, full report)
- ✅ **Regular tests (no coverage)**: 38 files, 282 tests, all pass (15-20s)
- ❌ **Full suite with coverage**: Hangs after E2E tests, logging stops at 19 lines

#### Evidence from Logs:
```
unit-2025-10-04-21-32-23.log (HUNG - 40+ minutes):
- 19 lines total
- Coverage enabled with v8
- E2E tests completed (3 files, checkmarks visible)
- Logging stopped, no further output
- Process never completed

unit-2025-10-04-21-47-59.log (SUCCESS - no coverage):
- 52 lines total  
- All 38 test files completed
- 282 tests passed
- Completed normally
```

#### Initial Coverage Snapshot (from single file run):
- **Types**: 100% coverage ✅
- **DeckScreen**: 26.5% line, 9% branch, 4% function
- **Hooks**: 10.53% line, 55% branch
- **Sharing**: 3.1% line, 60% branch
- **Most files**: 0% coverage (not tested)

#### Workaround Options:
1. **Run coverage on subsets**: Exclude E2E tests or run per-directory
2. **Use vitest directly**: `npx vitest run --coverage --exclude "src/test/e2e/**"`
3. **Investigate hang**: Possible issues with E2E browser cleanup, Firebase connections, or v8 coverage on large files
4. **Alternative**: Use Istanbul/c8 coverage tool instead of v8

#### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Generate partial coverage reports (exclude E2E)
2. Analyze gaps from partial coverage  
3. Create improvement roadmap based on available data
4. File issue to debug full coverage hang later

## Coverage Workaround - Approach



**Problem**: Full suite coverage hangs after E2E tests. Need coverage report without E2E.

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ❌ `--exclude "src/test/e2e/**"` - Vitest doesn't support this syntax, resulted in "No run files found"
2. ❌ Glob pattern `"src/test/{features,hooks,sharing}/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"` - PowerShell glob expansion issue
3. ⚠️ Direct vitest bypassing wrapper - Loses structured logging, can't track progress

**Working Solution**: 
Run coverage on individual test categories separately, then review HTML reports:

```powershell
# Option A: Run without E2E by using vitest config
node scripts/run-tests-log.mjs --coverage src/test/features/**
node scripts/run-tests-log.mjs --coverage src/test/hooks/**
node scripts/run-tests-log.mjs --coverage src/test/sharing/**

# Option B: Modify vitest config temporarily to exclude E2E
# Option C: Accept the single-file approach for detailed analysis
```

**Key Learning**: Always use `node scripts/run-tests-log.mjs` wrapper to maintain structured logging and progress tracking.

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days (critical path)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days (complex UI)
- **Phase 3**: 2 days (business logic)
- **Phase 4**: 2 days (data hooks)
- **Phase 5**: 1 day (integration)
- **Total**: ~2 weeks for world-class coverage

#### Quick Wins (Do First):
1. Types (already 100% ✅)
2. Pure utility functions in sharing (`collaborators.ts`, `accessibleDecks.ts`)
3. Hook operation tests (clear inputs/outputs)
4. Firestore basic CRUD (foundation for everything)
