#### 2. Interaction Performance
- [ ] Add collaborator response time benchmarks
- [ ] Remove collaborator operation speed

- [ ] Multiple rapid add/remove operations
- [ ] Dialog behavior during network interruption
- [ ] Memory leak detection during extended use

### Success Criteria
- Share dialog opens < 500ms
