# Performance Optimization: Virtualized Lists For 100+ Cards

**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** P1
**Status:** todo
**Owner:** CAMERON

## Description
Implement list virtualization using react-window to optimize rendering performance for decks with 100+ cards. Currently, rendering large card lists can cause performance issues (lag, slow scrolling). Virtualization renders only visible items, dramatically improving performance.

## Problem Statement
- CardScreen renders ALL cards in DOM simultaneously
- With 100+ cards: ~5-10 second initial render
- Scrolling performance degrades significantly
- Memory usage scales linearly with card count
- Mobile devices especially affected

## Solution: List Virtualization
Use **react-window** (maintained by Brian Vaughn, former React core team):
- Renders only visible items + buffer
- Constant DOM size regardless of list length
- Smooth 60fps scrolling even with 1000+ cards
- Minimal bundle size (~6kb gzipped)

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Performance Baseline
- [ ] Write performance benchmark tests (15 tests)
- [ ] Measure current render time for 100/500/1000 cards
- [ ] Measure current scroll FPS
- [ ] Measure current memory usage
- [ ] Document baseline metrics

### Phase 2: Virtualized Component
- [ ] Install react-window library
- [ ] Write TDD tests for VirtualizedCardList (20 tests)
- [ ] Implement VirtualizedCardList component
  - FixedSizeList for consistent card heights
  - Dynamic item height support (expanded/collapsed)
  - Preserve card interactions (expand, edit, reorder)
  - Maintain keyboard navigation
  - Maintain accessibility (screen readers)
- [ ] Handle edge cases (empty list, single card, filtering)

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Integrate VirtualizedCardList into CardScreen
- [ ] Preserve existing CardScreen functionality
  - Card expansion/collapse
  - Reorder mode with drag handles
  - Filtering and search
  - Snapshot loading
- [ ] Update CardScreen tests
- [ ] Test with real large datasets

### Phase 4: Performance Verification
- [ ] Run performance comparison benchmarks
- [ ] Verify 100 cards: <100ms initial render (vs ~5s)
- [ ] Verify 500 cards: <150ms initial render
- [ ] Verify 1000 cards: <200ms initial render
- [ ] Verify 60fps scrolling at all sizes
- [ ] Document performance improvements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Renders 100 cards in <100ms (current: ~5s)
- [ ] Renders 500 cards in <150ms
- [ ] Renders 1000 cards in <200ms
- [ ] 60fps scrolling with any list size
- [ ] Memory usage stays constant (~10MB vs linear growth)
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
  - Card expansion/collapse works
  - Reorder mode works
  - Filtering works
  - Keyboard navigation works
  - Screen readers work
- [ ] Performance tests passing (target: 35+ tests)
- [ ] No visual regressions
- [ ] Mobile performance improved (especially Android mid-range)

## Technical Notes
- **Library:** react-window v1.8.x
- **Strategy:** FixedSizeList with dynamic height fallback
- **Item Height:** 
  - Collapsed: 60px
  - Expanded: dynamic (measure with refs)
- **Buffer:** 5 items above/below viewport
- **Scroll Restoration:** Preserve scroll position on re-render
- **Accessibility:** Maintain ARIA roles, maintain keyboard nav

## Non-Goals
- Infinite scroll (pagination) - out of scope
- Server-side pagination - out of scope  
- Card animation during virtualization - acceptable tradeoff
