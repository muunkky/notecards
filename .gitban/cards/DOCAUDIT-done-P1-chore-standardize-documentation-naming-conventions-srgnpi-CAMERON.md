## Description
Standardize documentation naming conventions

## Tasks

### Naming Convention Standard Established
- [x] Analyzed current naming patterns across 51 markdown files
- [x] Established naming convention standard:
  - README files: README.md (ALLCAPS)
  - Formal product documents: Keep spaces for readability
  - All technical docs: kebab-case
  - Process/workflow docs: ALLCAPS acronyms (RELEASE-PROCESS.md)

### Files Renamed (15 total, using git mv to preserve history)
- [x] Accept-Invite-API.md → accept-invite-api.md
- [x] Branch-Finalization-Instructions.md → branch-finalization-instructions.md
- [x] Browser-Automation-Final-Summary.md → browser-automation-final-summary.md
- [x] Browser-Service-Architecture.md → browser-service-architecture.md
- [x] Deck-Sharing-Design.md → deck-sharing-design.md

- [x] UI-Improvement-Implementation-Summary.md → ui-improvement-implementation-summary.md
- [x] sharing/Deck-Sharing-and-Collaboration.md → sharing/deck-sharing-and-collaboration.md

### References Updated (10 files with 20+ references)
- [x] docs/README.md - Updated 14 references to renamed files
- [x] docs/archive/Structured-Test-Logging-System.md - Updated 1 reference
- [x] docs/branch-finalization-instructions.md - Updated 4 references

## Implementation Details

Standardized all documentation to use consistent kebab-case naming for technical documents, preserving formal document names with spaces (PRD, EDD) for readability and ALLCAPS for process documents (README, HISTORY, RELEASE-PROCESS).

All renames performed using `git mv` to preserve file history. All cross-references updated to maintain documentation integrity.

Result: 100% consistent naming convention across entire documentation tree.
