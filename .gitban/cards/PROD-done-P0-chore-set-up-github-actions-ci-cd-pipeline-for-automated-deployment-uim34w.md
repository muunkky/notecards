# Set Up GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline For Automated Deployment

**Type:** Chore
**Priority:** P0
**Status:** done
**Sprint:** PROD

## Description
Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment to Firebase Hosting on every push to main branch.

## Verification Complete ✅

### Workflow Files
- [x] `.github/workflows/prod-deploy.yml` - Production deployment
  - Triggers: Push to `main` branch
  - Steps: Install deps → Type check → Tests → Build → Deploy
  - Duration: ~1m30s
  - Secrets: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NOTECARDS_1B054, FIREBASE_TOKEN

- [x] `.github/workflows/ci-tests.yml` - Pull request testing
  - Triggers: PRs and feature branches
  - Steps: Full test suite + E2E tests
  - Firestore rules validation with emulator

- [x] `.github/workflows/dev-deploy.yml` - Development deployment

### Deployment History
Recent runs (Oct 25, 2025):
```
✅ SUCCESS - chore(cards): complete P0 bug
✅ SUCCESS - feat(deploy): add pre-flight Firebase auth check
✅ SUCCESS - fix: add Vite type definitions and deckInvites security rules
```

### Monitoring Tools
- [x] `gh run list` - View recent workflow runs
- [x] `gh run watch` - Watch current deployment
- [x] `gh run view <id> --log` - View detailed logs

### Local Pre-Push Hooks
- [x] `.githooks/pre-push` - Runs deployment checks before pushing to main
- [x] `scripts/install-hooks.sh` - Auto-installs hooks via `npm install`
- [x] `scripts/deploy-check.sh` - Pre-flight verification script

## Notes
CI/CD is fully automated. Just push to `main` and GitHub Actions handles:
1. Type checking (TypeScript)
2. Unit tests (Vitest)
3. E2E tests (Playwright)
4. Production build (Vite)
5. Firebase deployment

**Zero manual steps required.**
