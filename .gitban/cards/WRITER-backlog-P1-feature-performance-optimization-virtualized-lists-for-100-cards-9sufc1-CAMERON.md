# Performance Optimization: Virtualized Lists For 100+ Cards

**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** P1
**Status:** todo
**Owner:** CAMERON

## Description
Implement list virtualization using react-window to optimize rendering performance for decks with 100+ cards. Currently, rendering large card lists can cause performance issues (lag, slow scrolling). Virtualization renders only visible items, dramatically improving performance.

## Problem Statement
- CardScreen renders ALL cards in DOM simultaneously
- With 100+ cards: ~5-10 second initial render
- Scrolling performance degrades significantly
- Memory usage scales linearly with card count
- Mobile devices especially affected

## Solution: List Virtualization
Use **react-window** (maintained by Brian Vaughn, former React core team):
- Renders only visible items + buffer
- Constant DOM size regardless of list length
- Smooth 60fps scrolling even with 1000+ cards
- Minimal bundle size (~6kb gzipped)

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Performance Baseline
- [x] Write performance benchmark tests (14 tests)
- [x] Measure current render time for 100/500/1000 cards
- [x] Measure current scroll FPS
- [x] Measure current memory usage
- [x] Document baseline metrics

### Phase 2: Virtualized Component
- [x] Install react-window library
- [x] Write TDD tests for VirtualizedCardList (26 tests)
- [x] Implement VirtualizedCardList component
  - FixedSizeList for consistent card heights
  - Dynamic item height support (expanded/collapsed)
  - Preserve card interactions (expand, edit, reorder)
  - Maintain keyboard navigation
  - Maintain accessibility (screen readers)
- [x] Handle edge cases (empty list, single card, filtering)

### Phase 3: Integration (Deferred)
- [ ] Integrate VirtualizedCardList into CardScreen
- [ ] Preserve existing CardScreen functionality
  - Card expansion/collapse
  - Reorder mode with drag handles
  - Filtering and search

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] VirtualizedCardList component renders only visible items
- [x] 100 cards render in <100ms (benchmark test passing)
- [x] 1000 cards render in <200ms (benchmark test passing)
- [x] DOM size stays constant regardless of list length (verified in tests)
- [x] Scrolling maintains 60fps performance
- [x] Component works with click and edit interactions
- [x] Accessibility maintained (ARIA roles, keyboard nav)
- [x] Brutalist Writer theme styling applied
- [x] Empty state handling
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (40 tests passing)
- [ ] Integrated into CardScreen (deferred - requires architectural planning)

**10 of 11 criteria met.** CardScreen integration deferred to allow proper planning of complex integration.

## Technical Notes
- **Library:** react-window v1.8.x
- **Strategy:** FixedSizeList with dynamic height fallback
- **Item Height:** 
  - Collapsed: 60px
  - Expanded: dynamic (measure with refs)
- **Buffer:** 5 items above/below viewport
- **Scroll Restoration:** Preserve scroll position on re-render
- **Accessibility:** Maintain ARIA roles, maintain keyboard nav

## Non-Goals
- Infinite scroll (pagination) - out of scope
- Server-side pagination - out of scope  
- Card animation during virtualization - acceptable tradeoff

## Phase 1: Performance Benchmarks

- [x] Write performance benchmark tests (14 tests)
- [x] Establish performance targets:
  - 100 cards: <100ms render time
  - 500 cards: <150ms render time
  - 1000 cards: <200ms render time

- [x] Brutalist Writer theme styling

**Phase 2 Complete:** 26 component tests passing + 14 benchmark tests passing ✓
**Total Implementation:** 40 tests passing (14 benchmarks + 26 component)

## Phase 3: CardScreen Integration

- [ ] Analyze CardScreen complexity (drag-drop, filters, reordering, favorites)
- [ ] Design integration approach that preserves all features
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Implement conditional rendering (virtualized vs. standard based on card count)
- [ ] Test all CardScreen features with virtualized list
- [ ] Update existing CardScreen tests

**Phase 3 Status:** Requires careful planning due to CardScreen complexity
- CardScreen includes: drag-drop reordering, filters, search, favorites, archive, duplicate, expand/collapse, snapshots
- Virtualized list is ready for integration when approach is finalized
- Consider feature-flagged rollout or conditional rendering based on card count threshold

**Integration Note:** CardScreen line 760 is where `filteredCards.map()` renders cards non-virtually

## Status

**Phase 1 & 2 Complete:** VirtualizedCardList component is production-ready with 40 passing tests.

**Phase 3 (Integration) Deferred:** CardScreen integration requires significant architectural planning due to:
- Drag-and-drop reordering (react-beautiful-dnd)
- Complex filtering, search, and state management
- Multiple card operations (favorites, archive, duplicate)
- Expand/collapse and snapshot features

**Recommendation:** Create separate card for CardScreen integration when needed. The VirtualizedCardList component is ready to use in any new screens or simpler contexts.

**Value Delivered:**
- Reusable virtualized list component
- 50x performance improvement potential (5s → <100ms for 100 cards)
- Full test coverage (40 tests)
- Production-ready for any list rendering use case
