## Design Vision

Make the app "disguise" itself as a terminal while remaining tappable and intuitive.

## Implementation Ideas

- Monospace fonts (already have this)
- Terminal-style prompts and command aesthetics
- Black background with green/amber text options
- Blinking cursor effects
- But all elements remain clickable/tappable
- Touch-friendly despite terminal appearance
- Could show "command history" for navigation breadcrumbs

## Alignment with Writer Thesis

This perfectly aligns with the brutalist, utilitarian aesthetic:
- "Feels like infrastructure - solid, reliable, honest about what it is"
- Zero decoration philosophy
- Writer tool aesthetic
