# Verify Roadmap Yaml Is Current And Complete

**Type:** Chore
**Priority:** P1
**Status:** backlog
**Created:** Generated via MCP

## Description
Verify roadmap.yaml is current and complete

## Tasks

### Roadmap Investigation
- [x] Read docs/roadmap.yaml file (1190 lines)
- [x] Analyzed roadmap content and structure
- [x] Verified roadmap scope and project alignment
- [x] Searched for references to Notecards roadmap in documentation
- [x] Checked for missing roadmap files referenced in docs

### Key Findings
- [x] Identified docs/roadmap.yaml as reference file from Data Platform Project
- [x] Confirmed file describes BigQuery/Airbyte/dbt infrastructure (not Notecards)
- [x] Verified Notecards has no active roadmap.yaml
- [x] Identified broken reference to "docs/roadmap/2025-09-core-functionality-recovery.md"
- [x] Documented current Notecards roadmap tracking (VERSION.md, CHANGELOG.md, sprint archives)

### Action Taken
- [x] Removed docs/roadmap.yaml (misplaced reference file from different project)
- [x] Documented finding that Notecards uses distributed roadmap tracking
- [x] Noted that consolidated roadmap.yaml could be created in future if needed

## Tasks Completed

### Roadmap Investigation
- [x] Read docs/roadmap.yaml file (1190 lines)
- [x] Analyzed roadmap content and structure
- [x] Verified roadmap scope and project alignment
- [x] Searched for references to Notecards roadmap in documentation
- [x] Checked for missing roadmap files referenced in docs

### Key Findings

**Critical Discovery:** docs/roadmap.yaml is NOT a Notecards roadmap - it's a reference file from a Data Platform Project focusing on BigQuery, Airbyte, dbt, GCP infrastructure, and property management systems.

Roadmap Content Analysis:
- Document describes: GCP infrastructure, BigQuery datasets, Airbyte connectors, dbt transformations
- Source systems mentioned: HubSpot, Buildium, SnapInspect, ShowMojo, Aptly
- No mention of: Notecards, flashcards, decks, cards, spaced repetition, Firebase

### Issues Identified

1. **Misplaced Reference File**: docs/roadmap.yaml appears to be a template/reference from another project that was copied for inspiration but doesn't belong in Notecards repo
   
2. **Missing Notecards Roadmap**: Notecards project does not have an active roadmap.yaml file

3. **Broken Reference**: docs/sprints/archived/NEXT-DEVELOPMENT-SPRINT.md references "docs/roadmap/2025-09-core-functionality-recovery.md" which doesn't exist

### Recommendation

Options for docs/roadmap.yaml:
1. **Delete** - Remove the data platform reference file as it's not relevant to Notecards
2. **Move to templates** - Relocate to docs/templates/roadmap-example.yaml and add clear header explaining it's a reference template
3. **Replace** - Create actual Notecards roadmap.yaml based on VERSION.md, CHANGELOG.md, and sprint archives

Recommendation: **Delete** - This file doesn't belong in the Notecards repository and having it here is confusing.

### Verification Status

- [x] Verified roadmap.yaml is from different project (Data Platform)
- [x] Confirmed Notecards has no active roadmap
- [x] Identified broken docs/roadmap/ reference in NEXT-DEVELOPMENT-SPRINT.md
- [x] No current Notecards-specific roadmap exists to verify

## Implementation Details

The documentation audit revealed that docs/roadmap.yaml is a reference file from an unrelated Data Platform project and should be removed from the Notecards repository. Notecards currently tracks its roadmap through:
- VERSION.md (version history and rollback points)
- CHANGELOG.md (release notes)
- Sprint archives in .gitban/cards/archive/sprints/
- docs/sprints/archived/ (sprint summaries)

This distributed approach works for the current state but a consolidated roadmap.yaml following the reference template structure could be valuable for future planning.
