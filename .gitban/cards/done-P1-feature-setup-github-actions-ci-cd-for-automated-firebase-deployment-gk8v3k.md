# Setup GitHub Actions CI/CD for automated Firebase deployment

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (October 2025)

This card has been fully implemented and is now in production.

## Delivered CI/CD System

### GitHub Actions Workflows (3 files)

#### 1. CI Tests Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-tests.yml`)
**Triggers**: Pull requests to main, pushes to feature branches

**Steps**:
- Checkout code and setup Node.js
- Typecheck (TypeScript compilation)
- Run unit tests (307 tests via Vitest wrapper)
- Verify Firestore rules (emulator-based validation)
- Build application (Vite production build)
- Run E2E tests (preview server + automated testing)
- Upload test artifacts for debugging

**Performance**: ~3-5 minutes execution time

#### 2. Production Deployment (`.github/workflows/prod-deploy.yml`)
**Triggers**: Pushes to main branch (after PR merge)

**Steps**:
- Run full test suite (typecheck + tests + build)
- Deploy to Firebase Hosting
- Output deployment URL and details

**Live URL**: https://notecards-1b054.web.app

**Current Limitation**: Deploying hosting-only (not firestore:rules/indexes) due to service account permissions. Full deployment restoration tracked in card 6u41ml.

#### 3. Development Deployment (`.github/workflows/dev-deploy.yml`)
**Triggers**: Pushes to develop/staging/feature branches

**Purpose**: Preview deployments for testing before production

### Security Configuration
- Firebase service account configured via GitHub Secrets
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NOTECARDS_1B054` secret
- `FIREBASE_TOKEN` for Firebase CLI operations
- Minimal permissions granted to service account

### Quality Gates
✅ All tests must pass before deployment  
✅ TypeScript compilation required  
✅ Build validation (Vite)  
✅ Firestore rules verification  
✅ E2E tests executed  

### Production Metrics
- **Test Suite**: 307/307 tests passing
- **Build Time**: 10-25 seconds
- **Deployment Time**: ~2-3 minutes from merge to live
- **CI Pipeline**: ~3-5 minutes total

## Implementation Tasks Completed

- [x] Created `.github/workflows/ci-tests.yml` with comprehensive test pipeline
- [x] Created `.github/workflows/prod-deploy.yml` for automated production deployment
- [x] Created `.github/workflows/dev-deploy.yml` for preview deployments
- [x] Configured Firebase service account with GitHub Secrets
- [x] Integrated all test suites (unit, E2E, rules verification)
- [x] Added TypeScript typecheck to pipeline
- [x] Configured build validation with Vite
- [x] Set up test artifact uploads for debugging
- [x] Verified production deployment working (https://notecards-1b054.web.app)
- [x] Documented CI/CD system in docs/ci-cd/ directory

## Documentation Created (card 6u41ml)
- `docs/ci-cd/README.md` - Pipeline overview and workflows
- `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

## Known Issues & Future Work

**Service Account Permissions (tracked in card 6u41ml)**:
- Current: Hosting-only deployment
- Needed: Cloud Firestore Index Admin + Firebase Rules Admin roles
- Impact: Rules and indexes require manual deployment

**Enhancement Opportunities (card 6u41ml)**:
- Pre-commit hooks for YAML validation
- PR preview URL comments
- Coverage reporting without blocking
- Deployment smoke test checklist

## Success Metrics Achieved

✅ **Automated Deployment**: Main branch merges auto-deploy  
✅ **Test Gate**: All tests must pass before deploy  
✅ **Production Ready**: Live site operational  
✅ **Fast Pipeline**: <5 minute CI execution  
✅ **Reliable**: 100% success rate since implementation
