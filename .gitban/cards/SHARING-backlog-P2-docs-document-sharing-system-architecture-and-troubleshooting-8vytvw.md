# Document Sharing System Architecture & Troubleshooting Guide

## Objective
Create comprehensive documentation for the deck sharing system to support development, debugging, and maintenance. This includes architecture diagrams, troubleshooting guides, and testing procedures.

## Deliverables

### 1. Architecture Documentation (`docs/sharing/`)
- [ ] **System Architecture** - High-level flow diagrams for sharing workflows
- [ ] **Database Schema** - Firestore collections, indexes, and relationships
- [ ] **API Reference** - All sharing services and their contracts
- [ ] **Hook Documentation** - `useDecks` vs `useAccessibleDecks` usage patterns
- [ ] **Security Model** - Firestore rules explanation and role hierarchy

### 2. Troubleshooting Guide (`docs/sharing/troubleshooting.md`)
- [ ] **Common Issues** - "Missing permissions", authentication failures, etc.
- [ ] **Debug Procedures** - Step-by-step debugging with Firebase console
- [ ] **Index Management** - How to verify and rebuild Firestore indexes
- [ ] **Error Code Reference** - All possible error states and solutions
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Query optimization and monitoring

### 3. Development Setup (`docs/sharing/development-setup.md`)
- [ ] **Firebase Emulator Setup** - Local development environment
- [ ] **Test Data Seeding** - Scripts to create collaboration scenarios
- [ ] **Multi-User Testing** - How to test sharing between different accounts
