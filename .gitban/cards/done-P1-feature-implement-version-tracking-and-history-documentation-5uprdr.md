# Implement version tracking and history documentation

## Sprint: VERSIONING
**Goal:** Create comprehensive versioning and release management system

## Context
Need automated versioning system that:
- Uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Generates release notes from gitban cards and sprint archives
- Creates git tags automatically
- Maintains changelog and version history
- Integrates with CI/CD pipeline

## Current State
- VERSION.md exists with manual version tracking
- Sprint archives available in .gitban/cards/archive/sprints/
- CHANGELOG.md exists but needs automation
- No automated version bumping

## Related Cards
Part of VERSIONING sprint - see all cards with VERSIONING- prefix
