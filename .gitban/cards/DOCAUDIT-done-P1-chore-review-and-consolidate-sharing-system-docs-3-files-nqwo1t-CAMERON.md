# Review and Consolidate Sharing System Docs

**Type:** Chore
**Priority:** P1
**Status:** in_progress
**Owner:** CAMERON

## Description
Organize sharing system documentation into cohesive docs/sharing/ directory structure.

## Analysis
Found 4 sharing documentation files scattered across docs:
- **developer-guide-sharing-system.md** (835 lines) - Developer architecture guide
- **user-guide-sharing-collaboration.md** (477 lines) - End user guide
- **troubleshooting-guide-sharing-system.md** (1077 lines) - Support/troubleshooting
- **docs/sharing/Deck-Sharing-and-Collaboration.md** (184 lines) - Design spec

**Decision:** Keep all 4 - they serve different audiences and purposes. Organize under docs/sharing/.

## Tasks
- [x] Reviewed all 4 sharing documentation files
- [x] Confirmed each serves distinct purpose (user/dev/support/design)
- [x] Moved developer-guide-sharing-system.md to docs/sharing/
- [x] Moved user-guide-sharing-collaboration.md to docs/sharing/
- [x] Moved troubleshooting-guide-sharing-system.md to docs/sharing/
- [x] Created docs/sharing/README.md with navigation index
- [x] Organized by audience (users, developers, support)

## Result
✅ All sharing docs consolidated in docs/sharing/
✅ Clear navigation index with README
✅ Docs organized by audience (4 distinct guides)
✅ Root directory cleaned of sharing guides
