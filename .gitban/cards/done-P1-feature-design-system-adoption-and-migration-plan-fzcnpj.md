### Migration Plan Created: ADOPTION-MIGRATION-PLAN.md

**Comprehensive integration strategy covering:**

#### Executive Summary
- 2-3 week timeline (parallel to feature development)
- Low-risk incremental migration
- Reversible at any stage (additive, not destructive)

#### Three-Phase Approach

**Phase 1: Non-Destructive Integration** (Week 1)
- Initialize design system alongside Tailwind
- Add optional theme switcher for testing
- Zero breaking changes to existing code

**Phase 2: Component Migration** (Week 2)
- Gradual component-by-component migration
- Feature flags for controlled rollout
- Priority: New components → Shared → Features → Legacy

**Phase 3: Full Integration** (Week 3)
- Complete migration of core components
- Optional Tailwind bridging (utilities → tokens)
- 80% adoption target

#### Integration Patterns
- React hooks (useTheme, useTokens)
- Styled components integration
- TypeScript type safety
- Feature flag strategies

#### Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback time**: < 5 minutes (comment out initialization)
- **Coexistence**: Tailwind + Design System work simultaneously
- **Testing**: All 6 themes validated per component

#### Success Metrics
- Week 1: Zero regression bugs, 100ms theme switching
- Week 2: 3+ shared components migrated
- Week 3: 80% adoption, performance targets met
