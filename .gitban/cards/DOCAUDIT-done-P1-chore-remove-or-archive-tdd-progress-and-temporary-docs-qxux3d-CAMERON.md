# Remove or Archive TDD-PROGRESS and Temporary Docs

**Type:** Chore
**Priority:** P1
**Status:** in_progress
**Owner:** CAMERON

## Description
Move outdated progress tracking and temporary documentation files to archive.

## Files Identified
- **TDD-PROGRESS.md** (3.3K) - Dated August 29, 2025, development progress tracking
- **Structured-Test-Logging-System.md** (12K) - Test logging system documentation

## Analysis
- TDD-PROGRESS.md: Historical development progress, no longer actively maintained
- Structured-Test-Logging-System.md: Test logging documentation (check if superseded by README)
- Both are valuable historical documentation but not active references

## Tasks
- [x] Identified temporary/progress documentation files
- [x] Confirmed docs/archive/ directory exists
- [x] Moved TDD-PROGRESS.md to docs/archive/ (historical record)
- [x] Moved Structured-Test-Logging-System.md to docs/archive/
- [x] Verified README.md has current test logging documentation
- [x] Root directory cleaned of temporary docs

## Decision
✅ Archive: Both files moved to docs/archive/ (historical value, not current)
✅ README.md contains current test logging documentation

## Result
✅ Root directory cleaned of 2 temporary/progress files
✅ Historical documentation preserved in docs/archive/
✅ Active documentation remains easily accessible
