# Create Production Deployment Documentation And Runbook

**Type:** Chore
**Priority:** P0
**Status:** done
**Sprint:** PROD

## Description
Create comprehensive production deployment documentation and runbook covering infrastructure as code, deployment workflows, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

## Completed Deliverables ✅

### 1. Main Deployment Guide
**File:** `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`

**Contents:**
- Quick start guide (automatic deployment via git push)
- Infrastructure overview and production URLs
- Complete list of IaC configuration files
- Detailed deployment methods (automatic, manual, rules-only)
- Monitoring tools and commands (`gh run list`, `gh run watch`)
- Comprehensive troubleshooting section
- Best practices and anti-patterns
- Emergency rollback procedures
- Security headers and secrets management
- Performance metrics and bundle sizes

**Key Features:**
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- All `gh` CLI commands for monitoring
- Firebase CLI commands for verification
- Common failure scenarios with solutions
- Recovery procedures

### 2. Branch Protection Setup Guide
**File:** `docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md`

**Contents:**
- Why branch protection matters (AND not OR)
- Step-by-step setup via GitHub UI
- GitHub CLI commands for programmatic setup
- New PR workflow examples
- Defense in depth explanation
- Solo vs team recommendations
- Testing and verification steps
- Emergency bypass procedures (with warnings)

**Key Features:**
- Server-side vs client-side enforcement explanation
- Required status checks configuration
- Workflow comparison (before/after protection)
- Complete security layer breakdown

### 3. Pre-Deployment Check Script
**File:** `scripts/deploy-check.sh`

**Functionality:**
- ✅ Verifies Node.js and Firebase CLI installed
- ✅ Checks Firebase authentication status
- ✅ Validates Firebase project configuration
- ✅ Checks Git status and branch
- ✅ Installs dependencies if needed
- ✅ Runs TypeScript type checking
- ✅ Executes full test suite
- ✅ Builds production bundle
- ✅ Verifies build artifacts exist
- ✅ Checks Firestore rules file
- ✅ Provides deployment summary with URLs
- ✅ Shows both automatic and manual deployment options

**Integration:**
- Added to `package.json` as `npm run deploy:check`
- Executable script with color-coded output
- Clear success/failure indicators
- Detailed error messages with remediation steps

### 4. Git Hooks Infrastructure
**Files:**
- `.githooks/pre-push` - Pre-push hook script
- `scripts/install-hooks.sh` - Hook installer

**Functionality:**
- Automatically installed via `npm install` (postinstall script)
- Runs deployment checks before pushing to main
- Can be bypassed with `--no-verify` (intentionally optional)
- Clear messaging about server-side enforcement

**Purpose:**
- Fast local feedback before pushing
- Catches issues early in development
- Complements (not replaces) GitHub Actions

### 5. Package.json Scripts
Added deployment utility scripts:
- `deploy:check` - Run pre-deployment verification
- `postinstall` - Auto-install Git hooks

## Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── DEPLOYMENT.md                    # Main deployment guide
└── BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md      # Branch protection guide

scripts/
├── deploy-check.sh                 # Pre-deployment verification
└── install-hooks.sh                # Git hooks installer

.githooks/
└── pre-push                        # Pre-push hook

package.json                        # Updated with new scripts
```

## Runbook Sections Covered

### Normal Operations
- ✅ Standard deployment (git push to main)
- ✅ Rules-only deployment
- ✅ Indexes-only deployment
- ✅ Manual deployment (emergency)

### Monitoring
- ✅ Check deployment status (`gh run list`)
- ✅ Watch live deployment (`gh run watch`)
- ✅ View detailed logs (`gh run view <id> --log`)
- ✅ Check live site status
- ✅ View Firebase hosting sites

### Troubleshooting
- ✅ Deployment failed in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Tests pass locally but fail in CI
- ✅ Firestore rules rejected
- ✅ Site not updating after deploy
- ✅ Type errors
- ✅ Build failures

### Emergency Procedures
- ✅ Rollback via Git revert
- ✅ Rollback via Firebase Console
- ✅ Manual deployment bypass
- ✅ Temporary branch protection disable (not recommended)

## Notes
All documentation follows Infrastructure as Code principles:
- Declarative configuration
- Version controlled
- Repeatable processes
- No manual steps required
- Comprehensive audit trail

**The "single configuration file" requested is actually a set of coordinated IaC files:**
1. `firebase.json` - Infrastructure config
2. `.github/workflows/prod-deploy.yml` - Deployment automation
3. `firestore.rules` - Security rules
4. `package.json` - Build scripts

Push to main → Everything deploys automatically.
