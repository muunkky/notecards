# Gitban Template Schema & Examples

**Purpose**: This is the authoritative guide for creating card templates.
Read this to understand template design principles, then create your
own templates in `.gitban/templates/{card_type}.md`.

**For LLMs**: When asked "create a {type} template", read this example
and adapt the patterns to the specific card type requirements.

## Template Design Principles

### Core Philosophy

**Keep 3-6 sections REQUIRED, mark the rest as `(optional)`**

- **Required** = truly essential to understand/complete the work
- **Optional** = best practices, nice-to-haves, advanced scenarios
- Include freeform section at end for project-specific content
- Structure guides but doesn't constrain

### Validation Rules

Templates are validated to ensure structure with consistent `(optional)` marking:

1. **Section headings**: All `## Headings` required unless marked `## Heading (optional)`
2. **Checkboxes**: All `- [ ] Task` required unless marked `- [ ] Task (optional)`
3. **Table columns**: All `| Column |` required unless marked `| Column (optional) |`

**Validation philosophy**: Structure guides but doesn't constrain. Mark things optional liberally - aim for 3-6 required elements in each category.

**Two-level (optional) marking**:
- **Section-level**: `## Section (optional)` excludes ALL content in that section
- **Item-level**: `- [ ] Task (optional)` or `| Column (optional) |` excludes specific items

This gives maximum flexibility - mix required and optional items within the same section!

**Examples**:
```markdown
## Bug Description          ‚Üê Required section
## Impact Assessment (optional)   ‚Üê Optional section (all content skipped)

### Within a required section:
- [ ] Reproduce the bug      ‚Üê Required checkbox
- [ ] Write regression test (optional)   ‚Üê Optional checkbox

| Step | Expected | Actual | Screenshot (optional) |   ‚Üê Last column optional
```

## How to Create Your Templates

1. **Read this example.md file** to understand principles
2. **Create `.gitban/templates/{card_type}.md`** (e.g., bug.md, feature.md, security.md)
3. **Copy relevant patterns** from examples above
4. **Customize for your project's needs**
5. **Mark sections `(optional)` appropriately** (aim for 3-6 required)
6. **Add a freeform section at the end** for project-specific content

### Tips for Good Templates

- **Start minimal**: 3-4 required sections, expand later if needed
- **Mark liberally**: When in doubt, mark it `(optional)`
- **Include examples**: Show users what good content looks like
- **Use placeholders**: `{{variable}}` for values to be filled in
- **Add freeform section**: Always include `## Additional Notes (optional)` at end
- **Test with strict mode**: Create a card and see if validation feels right

---

## Extending with New Card Types

Want to add `security.md`, `epic.md`, `spike.md`, or custom types?

1. **Read this example.md for patterns**
2. **Create `.gitban/templates/{new_type}.md`**
3. **Follow the core principles** (3-6 required sections)
4. **Use consistent (optional) marking**
5. **No package updates needed!**

### Example: Creating a Security Card Template

```markdown
## Security Issue
[Description of the security concern - REQUIRED]

**Severity**: [Critical / High / Medium / Low]

**CWE/CVE**: [Reference if applicable]

## Impact
[Who/what is affected - REQUIRED]

- Affected systems: [List]
- Data at risk: [What data]
- Attack vector: [How exploited]

## Remediation
[How to fix - REQUIRED]

1. Immediate mitigation steps
2. Long-term fix
3. Verification steps

## Testing (optional)
[How to verify the fix]

- [ ] Vulnerability no longer exploitable
- [ ] Security scan passes

## Additional Notes (optional)
üìù FREEFORM SECTION - Add anything project-specific
```

## Template Validation Philosophy

**"Document reality, not theory"**

Templates should guide users toward complete, well-structured cards without
being prescriptive. The `(optional)` pattern gives teams flexibility to:

- **Adapt to project needs**: Different projects need different structures
- **Balance guidance and freedom**: Required sections guide, optional sections suggest
- **Evolve over time**: Start simple, add optional sections as needs grow
- **Support multiple workflows**: Same template works for various team processes

**Validation in action**:
- **Strict mode**: Enforces required elements, blocks card creation if missing
- **Advisory mode**: Warns about missing elements, allows card creation
- **None mode**: No validation, complete freedom

Teams can configure validation per card type to match their workflow.

## Questions?

- **"How many sections should be required?"** ‚Üí 3-6 is ideal
- **"Can I have more than 6 required sections?"** ‚Üí Yes, but consider if they're truly required
- **"Should I mark checkboxes optional?"** ‚Üí Mark quality metrics and nice-to-haves as optional
- **"Can I create custom card types?"** ‚Üí Absolutely! Just create the template file
- **"Do I need to update the package?"** ‚Üí No! Templates are workspace-only

---

## Design Decisions

### Why workspace-only templates?
- Full user control over template content
- No version conflicts with package updates
- Easy to share team templates via git
- Encourages project-specific customization

### Why single example.md instead of per-type?
- Easier maintenance (one file to update)
- Teaches principles, not just patterns
- Allows infinite extensibility
- Reduces coupling between package and workflow

### Why no built-in fallbacks?
- Forces conscious adoption (you understand your templates)
- Prevents surprise behavior changes
- Simpler mental model: workspace = source of truth

**Ready to create your first template?**

1. Run `restore_template_example()` to get this file in your workspace
2. Read through the patterns above
3. Create `.gitban/templates/{card_type}.md`
4. Test with strict validation enabled
5. Iterate based on team feedback

Happy template creating! üé®
