## Objective
Conduct a comprehensive audit of testing coverage across the entire codebase and establish a world-class testing strategy that matches the standards of elite engineering teams (Google, Meta, Netflix-level quality).

## Context
- Current testing infrastructure includes unit tests (294 tests), E2E tests, functions tests, and rules tests
- Need to identify gaps, establish coverage baselines, and create a roadmap to achieve exceptional testing quality
- Goal: Make testing so comprehensive that production bugs are virtually impossible

## Desired End State - World-Class Testing Standards

### Coverage Metrics (Google-Level Standards):
- **Line Coverage**: ≥ 90% across all production code
- **Branch Coverage**: ≥ 85% for all conditional logic
- **Function Coverage**: 95%+ for all public APIs
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% for authentication, data persistence, sharing, payments (if applicable)
- **Mutation Testing Score**: ≥ 80% (tests catch intentional bugs)

### Test Distribution (Industry Best Practices):
- **70% Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated, granular component testing
- **20% Integration Tests**: Service interactions, API contracts, database operations
- **10% E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys, acceptance criteria validation

### Test Quality Standards:
- **Test Reliability**: < 0.1% flaky test rate (tests must be deterministic)
- **Test Speed**: Unit test suite completes in < 2 minutes
- **Test Independence**: Zero interdependencies between tests (can run in any order)
- **Test Clarity**: Every test has clear Given/When/Then structure or equivalent
- **Test Maintenance**: < 5% of development time spent fixing tests (low maintenance burden)

### Documentation & Infrastructure:
- **Coverage Reports**: Automated generation with trends over time
- **Coverage Gates**: CI/CD fails if coverage drops below thresholds
- **Missing Coverage Report**: Clear identification of untested code paths
- **Test Strategy Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for all test types
- **Test Utilities**: Shared fixtures, factories, mocks properly organized

## Non-Objectives
- Not aiming for 100% coverage (diminishing returns after 90%)
- Not testing external library internals (only our usage of them)
- Not replacing manual QA entirely (some exploratory testing still valuable)
- Not creating tests that duplicate functionality (avoid test redundancy)

## Discovery Phase Checklist

### Current State Assessment:
- [ ] **Unit Test Coverage Analysis**:
  - [ ] Run coverage report with `npm run test:coverage`
  - [ ] Identify files with < 80% coverage
  - [ ] Document critical paths with < 100% coverage
  - [ ] Map uncovered branches and edge cases

- [ ] **Integration Test Inventory**:
  - [ ] Catalog all service-to-service interactions
  - [ ] Identify integration points lacking tests (Firebase, Auth, API calls)
  - [ ] Document data flow testing gaps
  - [ ] Review mock vs. real dependency strategy

- [ ] **E2E Test Coverage**:
  - [ ] Map all critical user journeys
  - [ ] Document which journeys have E2E tests
  - [ ] Identify untested happy paths

## Detailed Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Standards:

**What to Test:**
- All pure functions with edge cases
- React component rendering (all prop combinations)
- State management logic (reducers, actions, selectors)
- Utility functions and helpers
- Data transformations and formatting
- Business logic and calculations

**How to Test:**
- Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- One assertion per test (logical assertion, not literal)
- Test file co-located with source (e.g., `Button.test.tsx` next to `Button.tsx`)
- Use descriptive test names: `it('should disable submit when form is invalid')`
- Mock external dependencies (Firebase, APIs, browser APIs)

**Coverage Targets:**
- Critical business logic: 100%
- UI components: 85%
- Utilities/helpers: 95%
- Configuration: 70%

### Integration Testing Standards:

**What to Test:**
- Firebase auth + Firestore interaction
- Service layer orchestration
- Browser service + authentication flow
- Data synchronization between components
- Real-time listeners and subscriptions

**How to Test:**
- Use Firebase emulators for real service simulation
- Test actual network calls (not mocked)
- Verify data persistence and retrieval
- Test error handling and retry logic
- Validate transaction boundaries

**Coverage Targets:**
- All external service integrations: 90%
- Critical data flows: 100%

### E2E Testing Standards:

**What to Test:**
- Complete user journeys (signup → create deck → add cards → study)
- Critical workflows (sharing, collaboration)
- Error recovery scenarios (network failures, auth errors)
- Cross-browser compatibility (if needed)
- Mobile responsive behavior (if needed)

**How to Test:**
- Use real browser + real Firebase (or emulators)
- Test from user perspective (no implementation details)
- Focus on critical happy paths
- Test one user journey per test
- Keep E2E suite small and focused (< 30 minutes runtime)

**Coverage Targets:**
- Top 10 user journeys: 100%
- Error recovery paths: 80%

### Test Organization Best Practices:

```
src/
  components/
    Button/
      Button.tsx
      Button.test.tsx          # Unit tests
      Button.integration.test.tsx  # Integration tests (if needed)
  services/
    firebase/
      auth.ts
      auth.test.ts            # Unit tests
      auth.integration.test.ts # Integration with Firebase
  test/
    e2e/                      # E2E tests
    fixtures/                 # Test data factories
    helpers/                  # Test utilities
    setup/                    # Global test setup
```

### Test Data Strategy:

- **Factories**: Use factory functions for test data generation
- **Fixtures**: Store reusable test data as JSON/modules
- **Realistic Data**: Use production-like data (anonymized)
- **Randomization**: Use seeds for reproducible random data
- **Cleanup**: Always clean up test data (teardown hooks)

### Flaky Test Prevention:

- **No arbitrary waits**: Use `waitFor` with conditions
- **Proper async handling**: Always await promises
- **Deterministic data**: Use fixed timestamps, IDs
- **Isolated state**: No shared state between tests
- **Retry logic**: Only for E2E tests, never for unit tests

**Priority Justification**: P1 - Testing excellence is foundational to sustainable development velocity and product quality. Without comprehensive testing, every change risks regressions and slows down future development.
