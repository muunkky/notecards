# 🎯 **NEXT DEVELOPMENT SPRINT - HANDOFF UPDATE**

## **🎉 MAJOR UPDATE: Firebase Integration Complete!**

**Previous Status:** Planned Firestore integration  
**Current Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING!**

### **✅ Completed During Recovery Session:**
- **Real Firebase Project:** notecards-1b054 connected
- **Authentication:** Anonymous sign-in working perfectly

## **Priority 1: Fix Test Infrastructure (IMMEDIATE - 30 minutes)**

### **Goal:** Fix component test failures for reliable development

**Current Issue:** Component tests failing due to mock setup issues
```
Error: Cannot find role "button" with name "Create New Deck"
Error: Cannot find text content "My Decks"
```

**Root Cause:** vi.hoisted() mock configuration needs adjustment

**Tasks:**
1. **Fix vi.hoisted() mocks in test files**
   - Update DeckScreen.test.tsx mock setup
   - Verify useDecks hook mocking
   - Test auth provider mocking

2. **Validate test infrastructure**
   - Ensure all component tests pass
   - Verify test utilities working
   - Check factory functions

**Why First:** Tests are foundation for all future TDD work

## **Priority 2: Card Management System (NEXT 2-3 hours)**

### **Goal:** Build CardScreen component with TDD approach

**Tasks:**
1. **Test-drive CardScreen component**
   - Write comprehensive tests for card CRUD
   - Implement card list, creation, editing
   - Add card reordering and deletion

2. **Integrate with Firebase**
   - Connect to Firestore cards collection
   - Implement real-time card updates
   - Add proper loading/error states

**Why Second:**
- Completes core user journey (Decks → Cards)
- Uses proven TDD patterns from DeckScreen
- Leverages existing Firebase integration

2. **Screen transitions**
   - Add smooth transitions between screens
   - Test deep-linking capabilities
   - Improve mobile navigation

**Why Third:**
- Enhances user experience
- Simple implementation with current foundation
- Prepares for future feature additions

---

## **🚀 Updated Success Criteria:**

After these 3 priorities:
- ✅ **Working test infrastructure** for reliable TDD
- ✅ **Complete card management** with real Firebase backend
- ✅ **Professional navigation** between all screens
- ✅ **Production-ready application** with full feature set
- ✅ **100% TDD coverage** for all new features

## **⏱️ Updated Time Investment:** 3.5-5.5 hours total

## **🎯 Handoff Status:**
