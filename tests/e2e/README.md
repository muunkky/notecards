# End-to-End Testing

Comprehensive E2E testing for both development and production environments.

## Overview

E2E tests simulate real user workflows from start to finish, verifying that critical paths work correctly. Tests are organized by environment:
- **Dev Tests**: Comprehensive journey tests against local emulators
- **Smoke Tests**: Quick validation tests against production

## Test Modes

### Development Mode (`dev`)
- **Target**: Local dev server with Firebase emulators
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing during development
- **Features**: Full authentication, complete workflows, detailed screenshots
- **Runtime**: Variable (30s - 2min per journey)
- **When to use**: During feature development and pre-deployment validation

### Smoke Test Mode (`smoke`)
- **Target**: Production site (https://notecards-1b054.web.app)
- **Purpose**: Quick validation that site is functional
- **Features**: Basic checks (site loads, React app initializes, auth UI present)
- **Runtime**: < 30 seconds
- **When to use**: Post-deployment validation, CI/CD health checks

### Production Mode (`production`)
- **Target**: Production site
- **Purpose**: Full E2E testing against live environment
- **Features**: Complete user journeys on production
- **Runtime**: Variable
- **When to use**: Periodic comprehensive validation

## Environment Variables

Tests automatically detect the target environment using these variables:

### E2E_MODE (Recommended)
Explicitly sets the test mode:
```bash
E2E_MODE=smoke    # Run smoke tests against production
E2E_MODE=dev      # Run dev tests with emulators
E2E_MODE=production  # Run full tests against production
```

### E2E_TARGET (Legacy)
Alternative mode detection:
```bash
E2E_TARGET=local   # Same as E2E_MODE=dev
E2E_TARGET=smoke   # Same as E2E_MODE=smoke
E2E_TARGET=production  # Same as E2E_MODE=production
```

### LOCAL_URL
Override the test URL:
```bash
LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:5173  # Test against custom local URL
```

### Priority Order
1. `LOCAL_URL` (if set, forces URL)
2. `E2E_MODE` (if set, determines mode)
3. `E2E_TARGET` (if set, determines mode)
4. Default: `production` mode

## Test Philosophy

**User Journey Focus**: Each test represents a complete user story, not individual features.

**Visual Evidence**: Every step captures a screenshot showing the actual UI state.

**Environment Aware**: Tests adapt behavior based on target environment.

**Long Journeys**: Tests should cover realistic multi-step workflows, not isolated actions.

## Creating New Journeys

### 1. Choose a User Story

Focus on real user goals, not implementation details:
- ✅ "Share a deck with a friend"
- ❌ "Click the share button"

### 2. Plan the Journey

Break down into discrete steps:
```javascript
/**
 * User Journey E2E Test: [Journey Name]
 *
 * User Story:
 * As a [user type], I want to [goal],
 * so that [benefit].
 *
 * Journey Steps:
 * 1. [First action]
 * 2. [Second action]
 * ...
 *
 * Success Criteria:
 * - [Outcome 1]
 * - [Outcome 2]
 */
```

### 3. Implement the Test

Copy an existing journey as a template:
```bash
# For dev tests (with emulators)
cp tests/e2e/dev/journeys/01-create-deck-and-card.mjs \
   tests/e2e/dev/journeys/XX-your-journey.mjs

# For smoke tests (quick production checks)
cp tests/e2e/smoke/01-auth-and-create.mjs \
   tests/e2e/smoke/XX-your-smoke-test.mjs
```

Update:
- `JOURNEY_NAME` constant
- User story documentation
- Test steps
- Success criteria verification

### 4. Capture Evidence

Take screenshots at key moments:
- Before and after state changes
- Form interactions
- Success/error messages
- Final verification

```javascript
const screenshot = await takeScreenshot(page, step, 'descriptive-name');
if (screenshot) results.screenshots.push(screenshot);
```

### 5. Verify Success

Check that the user's goal was achieved:
```javascript
const success = await page.evaluate(() => {
  // Check for expected UI changes
  return document.body.textContent.includes('Success');
});

if (success) {
  console.log('✅ Journey completed successfully');
  results.passed.push('Journey goal achieved');
}
```

## Best Practices

### Make Journeys Realistic

✅ **DO**: Simulate actual user behavior
```javascript
// User creates deck, adds 3 cards, edits one, deletes one
```

❌ **DON'T**: Test edge cases or error conditions
```javascript
// Create 1000 decks to test pagination
```

### Capture Visual Proof

✅ **DO**: Screenshot before and after major actions
```javascript
await takeScreenshot(page, step, 'before-deck-creation');
await clickCreateButton();
await takeScreenshot(page, step, 'after-deck-creation');
```

❌ **DON'T**: Screenshot every minor interaction
```javascript
await takeScreenshot(page, step, 'mouse-hover-button');
```

### Choose the Right Test Mode

✅ **DO**: Use dev mode for comprehensive testing during development
```javascript
// Dev tests with emulators (full authentication and workflows)
LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:5173 npm run test:journey:01
```

✅ **DO**: Use smoke tests for quick production validation
```javascript
// Quick production health check after deployment
npm run test:e2e:smoke
```

❌ **DON'T**: Run comprehensive journey tests against production unnecessarily
```javascript
// Avoid this - use dev mode with emulators instead
E2E_MODE=production npm run test:journey:01
```

### Write Clear Documentation

✅ **DO**: Explain user intent and expected outcomes
```javascript
/**
 * User Story: As a teacher, I want to share my deck with students
 *
 * Expected: Students receive a shareable link
 */
```

❌ **DON'T**: Just describe technical steps
```javascript
// Click share button, copy link, done
```

## Running Tests

### Smoke Tests (Production Validation)

Quick production health checks (< 30s):
```bash
# Recommended: Use npm script
npm run test:e2e:smoke

# Or directly with E2E_MODE
E2E_MODE=smoke node tests/e2e/smoke/01-auth-and-create.mjs
```

### Dev Journey Tests (Local Emulators)

Comprehensive tests against local environment:
```bash
# Run specific journey
npm run test:journey:01  # Create deck and card
npm run test:journey:03  # Share deck

# Or directly with LOCAL_URL
LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:5173 node tests/e2e/dev/journeys/01-create-deck-and-card.mjs
```

### Production Journey Tests

Full user journeys against production:
```bash
# Set E2E_MODE to production
E2E_MODE=production node tests/e2e/dev/journeys/01-create-deck-and-card.mjs
```

### Legacy Journey Tests

Old location (being migrated):
```bash
npm run test:journey:02  # Edit and delete
npm run test:journey:04  # Bulk creation
npm run test:journey:05  # Deck management
```

### Examples

```bash
# Quick production check after deployment
npm run test:e2e:smoke

# Test against local dev server
LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:5173 npm run test:journey

# Test specific journey with custom URL
LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:5174 npm run test:journey:03

# Force production mode
E2E_MODE=production npm run test:journey:01
```

### View Results

Screenshots saved to:
```
tests/e2e/screenshots/[journey-name]/[timestamp]/
```

## Screenshot Organization

Each test run creates a timestamped folder with all evidence:

```
tests/e2e/screenshots/
└── 01-create-deck-and-card/
    ├── 2025-10-23T17-40-35/    # Successful run
    │   ├── 02-site-loads.png
    │   ├── 03-authenticated.png
    │   └── ...
    └── 2025-10-24T09-15-22/    # Another run
        └── ...
```

**File Sizes Indicate Success**:
- Small (~15KB): Modals, forms, error states
- Large (400-500KB): Full page content loaded

## Maintenance

### When to Update

Update journey tests when:
- UI changes affect critical paths
- New features alter user workflows
- Authentication flow changes
- Production URL changes

### When to Add New Journeys

Add new journeys for:
- New user-facing features
- Critical business workflows
- Common user tasks
- Frequently reported bugs

### When to Archive Journeys

Archive journeys when:
- Feature is deprecated
- Workflow fundamentally changes
- Test becomes obsolete

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Launch Fails

```bash
# Install Chromium for Puppeteer
npx puppeteer browsers install chrome
```

### Navigation Timeout

```javascript
// Increase timeout for slow production
await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle2', timeout: 60000 });
```

### Authentication Issues

```bash
# Clear browser session
rm -rf .browser-session/
```

### Screenshots Missing

```javascript
// Check directory exists
await fs.mkdir(SCREENSHOT_DIR, { recursive: true });
```
