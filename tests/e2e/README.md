# End-to-End User Journey Tests

Visual regression and functional testing for critical user journeys in production.

## Overview

E2E user journey tests simulate real user workflows from start to finish, capturing screenshot evidence at each step. These tests verify that critical paths work correctly in the production environment.

## Test Philosophy

**User Journey Focus**: Each test represents a complete user story, not individual features.

**Visual Evidence**: Every step captures a screenshot showing the actual UI state.

**Production Testing**: Tests run against the live production site to verify real-world behavior.

**Long Journeys**: Tests should cover realistic multi-step workflows, not isolated actions.

### 05: Deck Management

**User Story**: As a user organizing my learning materials, I want to create, rename, and delete decks.

**Steps**:
1. Load production site and authenticate
2. View current deck list
3. Create three new decks
4. Rename one of the decks
5. Delete one of the decks
6. Verify final deck list is correct

**Duration**: ~60 seconds (estimated)

**Run**:
```bash
npm run test:journey:05
```

## Creating New Journeys

### 1. Choose a User Story

Focus on real user goals, not implementation details:
- ✅ "Share a deck with a friend"
- ❌ "Click the share button"

### 2. Plan the Journey

Break down into discrete steps:
```javascript
/**
 * User Journey E2E Test: [Journey Name]
 *
 * User Story:
 * As a [user type], I want to [goal],
 * so that [benefit].
 *
 * Journey Steps:
 * 1. [First action]
 * 2. [Second action]
 * ...
 *
 * Success Criteria:
 * - [Outcome 1]
 * - [Outcome 2]
 */
```

### 3. Implement the Test

Copy an existing journey as a template:
```bash
cp tests/e2e/user-journeys/01-create-deck-and-card.mjs \
   tests/e2e/user-journeys/XX-your-journey.mjs
```

Update:
- `JOURNEY_NAME` constant
- User story documentation
- Test steps
- Success criteria verification

### 4. Capture Evidence

Take screenshots at key moments:
- Before and after state changes
- Form interactions
- Success/error messages
- Final verification

```javascript
const screenshot = await takeScreenshot(page, step, 'descriptive-name');
if (screenshot) results.screenshots.push(screenshot);
```

### 5. Verify Success

Check that the user's goal was achieved:
```javascript
const success = await page.evaluate(() => {
  // Check for expected UI changes
  return document.body.textContent.includes('Success');
});

if (success) {
  console.log('✅ Journey completed successfully');
  results.passed.push('Journey goal achieved');
}
```

## Best Practices

### Make Journeys Realistic

✅ **DO**: Simulate actual user behavior
```javascript
// User creates deck, adds 3 cards, edits one, deletes one
```

❌ **DON'T**: Test edge cases or error conditions
```javascript
// Create 1000 decks to test pagination
```

### Capture Visual Proof

✅ **DO**: Screenshot before and after major actions
```javascript
await takeScreenshot(page, step, 'before-deck-creation');
await clickCreateButton();
await takeScreenshot(page, step, 'after-deck-creation');
```

❌ **DON'T**: Screenshot every minor interaction
```javascript
await takeScreenshot(page, step, 'mouse-hover-button');
```

### Use Real Production

✅ **DO**: Test against live production site
```javascript
const PRODUCTION_URL = 'https://notecards-1b054.web.app';
```

❌ **DON'T**: Test against localhost or staging
```javascript
const LOCALHOST_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'; // No!
```

### Write Clear Documentation

✅ **DO**: Explain user intent and expected outcomes
```javascript
/**
 * User Story: As a teacher, I want to share my deck with students
 *
 * Expected: Students receive a shareable link
 */
```

❌ **DON'T**: Just describe technical steps
```javascript
// Click share button, copy link, done
```

## Running Tests

### Single Journey

```bash
node tests/e2e/user-journeys/01-create-deck-and-card.mjs
```

### All Journeys (Future)

```bash
npm run test:e2e:journeys
```

### View Results

Screenshots saved to:
```
tests/e2e/screenshots/[journey-name]/[timestamp]/
```

## Screenshot Organization

Each test run creates a timestamped folder with all evidence:

```
tests/e2e/screenshots/
└── 01-create-deck-and-card/
    ├── 2025-10-23T17-40-35/    # Successful run
    │   ├── 02-site-loads.png
    │   ├── 03-authenticated.png
    │   └── ...
    └── 2025-10-24T09-15-22/    # Another run
        └── ...
```

**File Sizes Indicate Success**:
- Small (~15KB): Modals, forms, error states
- Large (400-500KB): Full page content loaded

## Maintenance

### When to Update

Update journey tests when:
- UI changes affect critical paths
- New features alter user workflows
- Authentication flow changes
- Production URL changes

### When to Add New Journeys

Add new journeys for:
- New user-facing features
- Critical business workflows
- Common user tasks
- Frequently reported bugs

### When to Archive Journeys

Archive journeys when:
- Feature is deprecated
- Workflow fundamentally changes
- Test becomes obsolete

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Launch Fails

```bash
# Install Chromium for Puppeteer
npx puppeteer browsers install chrome
```

### Navigation Timeout

```javascript
// Increase timeout for slow production
await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle2', timeout: 60000 });
```

### Authentication Issues

```bash
# Clear browser session
rm -rf .browser-session/
```

### Screenshots Missing

```javascript
// Check directory exists
await fs.mkdir(SCREENSHOT_DIR, { recursive: true });
```
