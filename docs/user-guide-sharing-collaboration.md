## 📚 Understanding Sharing Basics

### 🔐 Permission Levels

| Role | Can View | Can Edit | Can Share | Can Delete |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Owner** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Editor** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

### 🎯 Key Concepts

**Deck Owner:** The person who created the deck. Only owners can:
- Add or remove collaborators
- Change collaborator permissions
- Delete the deck

**Collaborators:** People invited to work with your deck:
- **Editors** can modify content but can't invite others

**Invitations:** Email-based invites that automatically connect when recipients create accounts
