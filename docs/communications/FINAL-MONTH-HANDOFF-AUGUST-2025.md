## 🔥 CRITICAL HANDOFF BLOCKERS

### ⚠️ PRIORITY 1 (RESOLVED): Git Repository Synchronization
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-01)  
**Impact**: NO LONGER BLOCKING  
**Reference**: `docs/communications/GIT-WORKFLOW-AND-PRACTICES.md`

**Summary**:
- Prior divergence (unrelated histories) fully remediated
- Full codebase restored and validated via test run
- Safety tag + backup bundle retained

**Preventative Measures Implemented**:
- Dedicated Git workflow document added
- Force push policy restricted to emergency playbook
- Recommendation to add CI + branch protection

**Action Required Going Forward**:
1. Enable branch protection rules on `main`
2. Add CI workflow (tests + lint) as required check
3. Follow new sync procedure before each PR

---

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### For Incoming Team (Day 1)
1. **Pull Latest Main** - Confirm clean sync (`git pull --ff-only`)
2. **Environment Setup** - Follow `README.md` instructions
3. **Run Test Suite** - Confirm current pass count
4. **Review Git Practices** - Read `GIT-WORKFLOW-AND-PRACTICES.md`
5. **Start Feature Branch** - `git checkout -b feature/<topic>`

### Development Priorities (Week 1)
1. **Fix Failing Test** - Resolve 1/211 failing test
2. **Code Review** - Familiarize with recent changes
3. **Performance Audit** - Optimize where needed
4. **Documentation Update** - Add any missing context
5. **Deployment Pipeline** - Verify production readiness
