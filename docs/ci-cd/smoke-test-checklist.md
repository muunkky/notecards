# Deployment Smoke Test Checklist

Post-deployment verification checklist for the Notecards application.

## Purpose

This checklist ensures critical functionality works after every production deployment. Execute these tests immediately after deployment completes to catch issues before users are affected.

**Execution Time**: 5-10 minutes
**Frequency**: After every production deployment
**Executor**: Developer who deployed or QA team member

   - Minor (UI bug, performance degradation) ‚Üí Consider hotfix

2. **Execute Rollback if Needed**:
   ```bash
   # Quick rollback (2-5 min)
   # See rollback-procedures.md
   ```

3. **Document Failure**:
   - Screenshot errors
   - Save console logs
   - Record failed test steps

## Automation (Future Enhancement)

### Automated Smoke Tests

```bash
# Conceptual automated test script
npm run smoke-test:production

# Would execute:
# - Puppeteer/Playwright tests
# - Critical path automation
# - Screenshot comparison
# - Performance benchmarks
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster execution (2-3 min vs 10 min manual)
- Consistent testing
- Can run on every deployment automatically
- Historical test result tracking

**Implementation**: Track in future card
