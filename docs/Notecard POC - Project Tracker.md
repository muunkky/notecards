This document tracks the major milestones for the development of the Notecard Proof of Concept.

## How to Use This Tracker: Development Workflow

This tracker is the single source of truth for the POC development. To ensure a smooth and organized workflow, all engineers should follow these steps when taking on a task.

### 1. Taking a Task

Find a task in the tables below with the status `Not Started`.

To claim it, edit this document and add your initials to the `Owner` column and change the `Status` to `In Progress`.

### 2. Branching

All work must be done in a feature branch, created from the `main` branch.

Branch names should follow this convention: `[type]/[short-description]`.

*   `type`: `feature` for new functionality, `fix` for bug fixes, `chore` for maintenance.
*   `short-description`: A few words describing the task (e.g., `deck-creation-modal`).

**Example:** `git checkout -b feature/deck-rename-functionality`

### 3. Committing

We will use the Conventional Commits specification. This makes our commit history readable and helps automate changelogs in the future.

Your commit message must be structured as: `type: subject`.

*   `feat`: A new feature.
*   `fix`: A bug fix.
*   `docs`: Documentation only changes.
*   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
*   `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools.

**Example:** `git commit -m "feat: implement firestore service to create new decks"`

### 4. Submitting for Review & Updating the Tracker

When your work is ready for review, open a Pull Request (PR) to merge your feature branch into the `main` branch.

Update the `Status` of your task to `In Review` and add a link to the PR in the `Notes` column.

After your PR has been approved and merged, change the `Status` to `Done`.
